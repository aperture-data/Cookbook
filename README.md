# Cooking with ApertureDB

## About ApertureDB
Our flagship product is ApertureDB, a database purpose-built for multimodal AI that combines
fast vector search with a graph database, and allows our users to access data. Head over to
[our documentation](https://docs.aperturedata.io) to learn more.

## About Cookbook Dataset
In order to demonstrate ApertureDB capabilities and provide some hands-on tutorial,
we have curated a dataset comprised of food images, cooking videos, and relevant metadata.
** This repository provides the dataset and notebooks that can take you on a culinary journey
from a beginner to an expert ApertureDB user**.
