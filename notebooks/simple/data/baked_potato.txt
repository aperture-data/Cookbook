Perfect Baked Potato
Cook Time: 1 hour hr
Serves 4
Bake a potato perfectly every time! With the olive oil & sea salt coating, it'll come out of the oven with crispy skin and fluffy insides that are delicious with your favorite toppings.
Equipment

    Baking Sheets (I use these nonstick ones from USA Pan Bakeware!)
    Parchment Paper (this one doesn't burn)

Ingredients

    4 medium russet potatoes
    Extra-virgin olive oil
    Sea salt

Instructions

    Preheat the oven to 425Â°F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
    Use a fork to poke a few holes into the potatoes. Place on the baking sheet, rub with olive oil, and sprinkle liberally with sea salt all over. Bake 45 to 60 minutes, or until the potato is fork-tender and the skin is crisp.
    Slice open each potato, fluff the insides, and serve with desired toppings.
